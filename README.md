# Next.js Dynamic Route Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js applications related to data fetching in dynamic routes using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.  The error arises from insufficient sanitization and error handling of dynamic route segments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or build failures.

## Problem

When fetching data for a dynamic route (e.g., `/product/[id]`), improper handling of the `id` parameter can cause problems:

* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Unsanitized input can be exploited for SQL injection or other attacks.
* **Unexpected Data:**  Incorrect or missing data might lead to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior.
* **Build Errors:** With `getStaticProps`, a failure to handle missing data can halt the entire build process.

## Solution

The solution involves robust sanitization and comprehensive error handling:

1. **Sanitize Input:**  Validate and sanitize the dynamic route segment (`id` in this example) to prevent malicious input.
2. **Handle Missing Data:** Implement checks to handle cases where data is missing or cannot be fetched.
3. **Graceful Error Handling:** Use try-catch blocks to catch potential errors and display appropriate messages or fallback content.
