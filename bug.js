In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getStaticProps or getServerSideProps) within a dynamic route.  If the dynamic route segment isn't handled correctly in the data fetching function, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  For example, consider a page at `/product/[id].js` attempting to fetch data for a product with the given `id`. If the `id` isn't properly sanitized or checked, and a user tries to access `/product/malicious-code`, the `getStaticProps` might try to use the `malicious-code` string directly in a database query, leading to unexpected data or security vulnerabilities.  Another scenario: if `getStaticProps` doesn't handle missing data gracefully, an error might be thrown and the page might not render correctly. This is particularly problematic during build time with `getStaticProps` because it can halt the build process.
